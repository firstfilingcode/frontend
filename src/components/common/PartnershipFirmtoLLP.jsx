              The law relating to partnership firm in India is prescribed in the
              Indian Partnership Act of 1932. This Act lays down the rights and
              duties of the partners between themselves and other legal
              relations between partners and third persons, which are incidental
              to the formation of a partnership.

                <li>
                  The agreement must be built to share the profits obtained from

              What is Limited Liability Partnership ( LLP )
            </p>

            <p className="partnershiptollp_p">
              A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is one in which some or all
              of the partners are limited in their liability. As a result, it
              can display aspects of partnerships and businesses. Each partner
              in an LLP is not responsible or liable for the misbehavior or
              carelessness of another partner.
            </p>

            <p className="partnershiptollp_p">
              A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) can be a far more effective
              business vehicle than a traditional partnership. Personal
              liabilities harm partnerships, while LLPs eliminate the Indian
              Partnership Act, 1932â€™s burdensome requirements. There are also
              tax advantages, no audit obligations below a particular capital
              threshold, no cap on the number of partners, and no capital
              contribution requirements. In this blog, there will be a detailed
              explanation on LLP over Partnership Firm, process to convert
              Partnership Firm into LLP, Documents needed for conversion, and
              other related information.

            <p className="partnershiptollp_p">
              Apart from the key differences, there are a few features that make
              the LLP a more desirable option over a standard partnership firm:
            </p>

            <div className="itrliNEw">

              <p>Freedom of Management/Flexibility:</p>
            </div>

            <p className="fearItrp">
              The partners are given a reasonable level of flexibility in
              conducting the operations and running the day to day affairs of
              the LLP. The LLP Agreement is not mostly influenced by the Limited
              Liability Partnership Act, 2008, which means to say that the Act
              is comparatively flexible on how the agreement can be drawn up.
            </p>

              <p>Perpetual Succession:</p>
            </div>

            <p className="fearItrp">
              Unlike in the traditional partnership, the death of the partner
              does not affect the existence of the LLP. The separate legal
              entity feature of the LLP allows it to carry on business.

            </div>

            <p className="fearItrp">
              Foreign investors and venture capital funds look at LLPs as an
              investment opportunity as it has a corporate structure and is more
              organised as opposed to traditional partnerships.
